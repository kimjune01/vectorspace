Natural light and plants improve mood and concentration. Temperature between 68-72Â°F optimizes cognitive function. Noise levels matter - moderate ambient noise can boost creativity, but loud noise impairs focus. Color psychology suggests blue enhances focus while green reduces eye strain. Social environment influences behavior through peer effects and social norms. Digital environment design (app interfaces, notification settings) shapes attention patterns and habits."}

While classical bits are either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can be in 'superposition' - both 0 and 1 simultaneously until measured.

Google claimed 'quantum supremacy' in 2019, though practical applications remain limited. Current challenges include quantum error correction, maintaining coherence, and scaling up qubit counts.

Long-term memory includes explicit memory (conscious facts and events) and implicit memory (unconscious skills and habits).

Retrieval practice - testing yourself is more effective than re-reading. Interleaving - mixing different topics improves discrimination and transfer. Elaborative interrogation - asking 'why' and 'how' questions deepens understanding. Dual coding - combining verbal and visual information. The generation effect - producing answers rather than recognizing them. Distributed practice - spreading learning over time beats cramming. These techniques work because they align with how our memory systems naturally function."},

Practice active recall instead of passive review. Create meaningful connections between new and existing knowledge. Use multiple senses when learning (see, hear, touch). Get adequate sleep - memory consolidation happens during sleep. Exercise regularly to promote neuroplasticity. Minimize interference by organizing learning sessions. Use external memory aids (calendars, notes) strategically. Pay attention fully when encoding information. Review material just before sleep for better consolidation."}

Interoperability between different blockchain networks is limited. Storage costs increase as blockchain size grows. 51% attacks are possible on smaller networks.
