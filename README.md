## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+** with `uv` package manager
- **Node.js 18+** with `pnpm` package manager

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies and start backend
cd backend/backend
uv sync
uv run python main.py

# Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
# API docs available at http://localhost:8000/docs

# Optional: Seed database with test user for development
uv run python seed_database.py
# Creates test user: testuser/testpass (Red Panda)
```

### Frontend Setup  
```bash
# Install dependencies and start frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Corpus Service (External Content Discovery)
```bash
# Optional: Set up external content discovery from Hacker News
cd corpus
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env file

# Install dependencies and start corpus service
uv sync --no-dev
uv run python main.py

# Corpus service runs on http://localhost:8001
# Automatically integrates with main backend for external content
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run backend tests (229+ tests in ~2 seconds!)
cd backend/backend
uv run python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run python -m pytest --cov=app

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
pnpm run test
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application works out of the box with default settings. For production, configure:

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
# AI Integration (optional - uses mock AI by default)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# JWT Secret (auto-generated if not provided)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

# Database (SQLite by default)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./conversations.db
```
